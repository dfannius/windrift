                <p>
                    Whenever a user selects an option from a <code>Choice</code>, the option text is
                    added to a global store called the <code>Inventory</code>. The inventory is a
                    key/value store where the keys are each choice's <code>tag</code> attribute. The
                    inventory for a key is unpopulated until a user has made a selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the inventory is global to the entire story, you can retrieve any
                    Choice's selection from any chapter. Back in the initial chapter on choices, you
                    picked a fruit—we'll use this as the example value in this chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two ways to retrieve the value from the inventory. One is to use the
                    <code>useInventory</code> React hook to retrieve the raw value selected by the
                    user. The other is to use the <code>Response</code> component to map specific
                    inventory selections to responses.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    The <kbd>useInventory</kbd> hook
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This hook give you access to the raw value provided by the users for any tag
                    passed in the array.

                <p>
                    Often selections will contain multiple words, when in the narrative you may want
                    to only pick the noun. In English, this is typically the last word in the
                    phrase. The utility function <code>wordFromInventory</code>
                    can safely retrieve a specific substring based on a negative offset from the end
                    of the string (default to -1). The offset value will apply to every option in
                    the choice, so if you're planning on using this you'll either want options with
                    similar structure, or a custom rendering function:

                    In most hypertext stories you will want to branch content and even navigation

                    <code>Choices</code> and <code>Responses</code> will make up the majority of

                    A <code>Response</code> is composed of a <code>tag</code> that matches the

                    The parameters in the <code>options</code> map should contain substring matches
                    of the original options. You can match by explicit wildcards too, which will
                    override the default substring behavior in favor of exactly what you provide.

                    Because a <code>Response</code> match can be any React node, you can branch from

                    The <code>Response</code> component specifically expects to receive inventory

                    Be aware that if you write a <code>Choice</code> including a <code>last</code>{' '}
                    parameter, the value of <code>last</code> is <em>not</em> stored in the

                    design principle of Windrift is that it should always be clear to the user that
                    a option was deliberately selected. (This is one reason why Twine-style{' '}

                    the case where a choice may never be presented to a user because they did not
                    uncover that path.
